Hello, welcome to the game -

Before you start, you may need to include "winmm" in your linker settings:
navigate Project->Build options->linker settings->add

In menu:
To navigate the startup menu, use WA for up and down, and D for select

press x for debug mode - clip through walls, sounds off, no fog of war

In game:

Controls:

  WASD keys to move around
  Q = LOOK LEFT
  E = LOOK RIGHT
  LeftShift = SPRINT
  Space = Attack


You should wear headphones while playing, for the background music and for
the sound effects.

The console should have resized automatically, but in case it didn't,
the screen should be 120 columns by 40 rows. You can change this by
going into the properties of the console window


This is mostly just to showcase mechanics. I really wished I could have more of a 
storyline, but seeing as it is due by the end of this week as I write this, things 
aren't looking too "cash money" as they say. 


around 200 lines of code (for raycasting and collision detection mostly) 
were "borrowed" from Javidx9 over Github, and he has an excellent video explaining
how these mechanics work.


The rest was done by me (Will Chartrand) and I'm currently writing this on
Wednesday, April 6th, 2021


I really wish that I had more time than I was given to work on this. I definitely
didn't get to add all of the features I wanted to, such as the Load game
(which does load the last played level) and other potions/enemies/traps and stuff.

Anyways, thanks for playing, I hope you and your family is safe during the lockdown, 
and have fun marking all of these assignments.
