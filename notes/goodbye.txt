Hope you liked it,
Unfortunately time was very limited, as I do have a job and whatnot, along with
the fact that we are in a quadmester and we don't have enough time for anything really

If I had more time, I would have added more items, levels and monsters, 
as well as a storyline so that there's an actual reason for why you're in
a maze in the first place. 

Anyways, peace out
